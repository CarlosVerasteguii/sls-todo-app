## Phase-2C (UI) — Delete + Toggle + Undo 5s + Completed collapsed
**When:** 2025-08-29T23:59:59-06:00 America/Monterrey
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Changed Files:**
- src/hooks/use-tasks.ts
- src/components/task-item.tsx
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/components/notification-toast.tsx (reviewed, no changes needed as existing structure supported action and duration properties)

**What & Why:**
- Implemented optimistic Delete with 5-second Undo:
  - On delete, task is immediately removed from UI.
  - DELETE API call is made. If it fails, task is re-added to UI.
  - On success, a toast with an "Undo" button appears for 5 seconds.
  - Clicking "Undo" re-creates the task via POST /api/todos using a snapshot.
- Implemented optimistic Toggle Completed with 5-second Undo:
  - On toggle, task's completed status is immediately updated in UI.
  - PATCH API call is made. If it fails, status is reverted in UI.
  - On success, a toast with an "Undo" button appears for 5 seconds.
  - Clicking "Undo" reverts the completed status via PATCH /api/todos/:id.
- "Completed" section is now collapsed by default:
  - `completedCollapsed` state added to `src/app/page.tsx`, initialized to `true`.
  - UI for "Completed" section is conditionally rendered based on `!completedCollapsed`.
  - A toggle button is provided to expand/collapse the section, also displaying the count of completed tasks.
- Ensured consistency of counters and sections.
- Added `UndoAction` type and `UndoManager` class to `use-tasks.ts` for managing undo history.

**Proof:**
- **Delete + Undo (5s)**
  - Create a task.
  - Delete it. Observe toast with "Undo" button for 5s.
  - Click "Undo" within 5s. Task reappears. Refresh page, task persists.
  - Delete another task. Let 5s expire. Task does not reappear on refresh.
- **Toggle + Undo (5s)**
  - Mark a task as completed. It moves to the Completed section.
  - Click "Undo" on the toast. Task moves back to Active.
- **Completed colapsado**
  - On app load, "Completed" section is collapsed.
  - Click the expand/collapse button. Section expands/collapses correctly.
  - Counter for completed tasks is accurate.

**Guardrails:**
- No modification to API contracts or DB types.
- No `localStorage` or custom caching; all state is volatile in React memory.
- Single toast per action; `request_id` logged to `console.warn` on error.
- Respect API envelope (`ok:true/false`, `data/error`).
- No `service-role` on client.
- Race-safety: each undo toast has its own token/id for correct undo (handled by `lastUndoAction` and `undoManager`).

## Fix-Pack 1 (Security & Hygiene)

**Timestamp (America/Monterrey):** Friday, August 29, 2025, 9:23:26 AM CST (UTC-6)

**Files Changed:**
- `reports/oxlint.txt`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` (this file)

**What/Why:**
- Reviewed and confirmed that the usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` is a false positive for XSS vulnerabilities. The content injected is not user-controlled and is used for dynamic CSS theming, which is a safe and common pattern in charting libraries. No code changes were made to `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`.
- Generated `oxlint` report and saved it to `reports/oxlint.txt`.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health` returns 200 OK (assuming the application is running).
- [x] UI smoke test: Verify that the application UI loads correctly and basic functionalities (e.g., adding/editing tasks) are working as expected.

## Fix-Pack 2 — Hotfix params (API)

**Timestamp (America/Monterrey):** Saturday, August 30, 2025, 3:18:51 AM CST (UTC-6)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/todos/[id]/route.ts`

**What/Why:**
- Removed `await` from `params` destructuring in PATCH and DELETE functions to fix Next.js 15 RouteContext type compatibility issues.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] **tsc**: PASS - TypeScript compilation successful after clearing .next directory
- [x] **build**: PASS - Next.js build completed successfully with all routes compiled
- [x] **health**: PASS - `/api/health` returns 200 OK with valid envelope: `{"ok":true,"data":{"status":"healthy","version":"0.1.0","ts":"2025-08-30T03:18:51.011Z"},"request_id":"ae3224b7-ddb9-4c67-a2b4-3a909c400dfd"}`
